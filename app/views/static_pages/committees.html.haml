  %p
    Startup Victoria is a nonprofit member based organisation and it relies heavily on generous help from our many volunteers. In order to coordinate Startup Victoria's quest to strengthen the startup ecosystem in Victoria we have created a range of committees that meet regularly to manage various important streams of activities.

    All the committees are looking for volunteers so if you would like to be part of Startup Victoria please

        Better Founders Committee
      %p
        The Better Founder Groups is an initiative to connect hand picked tech founders so they can share their learnings and as a collective help each other achieve more. The Committee has organised groups of 10 founders who meet once a month for dinner to discuss their experiences in their startups. This is the one place where you don't have to pitch your startup and where you can talk to your peers.
      %p
        If you are a tech founder and you would like to join a group, please 
        %a{ href: "/contact-us" }
          contact us.
